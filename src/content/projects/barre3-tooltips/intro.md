One of my early projects at barre3 was to prototype and design a tooltips flow for new users, guiding them through the features of the online subscription.

I partnered with our Senior UX Designer on this project to conduct competitive analysis, build out user flows, and wireframe, before I created high-fidelity designs.

### results

This project was a good learning opportunity, because ultimately, although our work met the objective, we ended up putting a pause on this project and moving forward with an out-of-the-box solution from our customer service management tool, Intercom.

Because this project was early in my career at barre3, it was useful in my understanding of our new usersâ€™ experience of the online subscription, and our existing limitations re: engineering bandwidth and product priorities.
