When I first started as a designer at barre3, they had a solid foundational design system in place, but no clear documentation defining usage or utilization as a brand. One of my first tasks in this job was to do a thorough audit of the existing system, correct and address any inconsistencies, and conclude with guiding documentation as a stake in the ground for the future product team.
