The Discover page is the first page users see when they log on to the barre3 online experience. The page was originally designed back in 2019 and hadn’t had a large overhaul in nearly four years when I started on this project.

The task was to take user data + feedback and create an updated experience to accomplish three things:

– get users to their desired workout faster
– streamline content and simplify the page
– create a stronger brand presence

### results

After pushing Discover Page 2.0, average number of workouts watched per week increased from 2.1 to 2.8 over a six month period – an increase of almost one full workout per week (for engaged users).
