Similarly, the new filter results page features the same redesigned filter at the top, so that users can quickly calibrate their choices and refine their selections at a glance.

The entire redesign was designed to be extremely user-friendly, while keeping the desktop experience as a priority, since barre3â€™s data indicates that most of our users work out using a desktop device.

As the sole digital product designer at barre3, I was responsible for the wire framing, UI, and prototyping of this project, in tandem with the product and engineering team.
