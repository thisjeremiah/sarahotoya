In 2022, the product team set out to update and simplify the user onboarding experience to barre3 online. Previously, the user was funneled through dozens of pages to click through, in an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the entire online subscription â€“ without actually letting them experience it. The drop off and opt out rates were both extremely high.

As a solve for this, I worked with the product team to trim down the content and focus primarily on getting a user to their first workout, since the data indicated that users who completed a workout during their first session of barre3 online were much more likely to return to the product than those who did not.
